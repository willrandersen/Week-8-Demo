## Assignment
Create a new Github Repository.

This week you will create a website that displays API information. You are to create an HTML form that POSTs a query to your Express backend. You are to parse this query using Express routes (like the examples you've seen in class). Then, your app should integrate with an external API (you can use anything) and display the results on the user's screen.

[Here's a list of APIs You Can Use (You're welcome to use any others)](https://any-api.com/)

TLDR;
- Make an HTML Form
- Post Form to Express Backend
- Parse Form and Make External API Request
- Display results to user.
